# GitHub Copilot CLI preToolUse adapter for the primary's seatbelts.
#
# Registered in tracked .github/hooks/firstmate-primary.json. It runs the three
# existing PreToolUse checks - bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh,
# bin/fm-cd-pretool-check.sh and bin/fm-subagent-pretool-check.sh, which stay
# the single owners of every decision and of their primary-checkout scope - and
# re-emits the first deny as Copilot's own decision object:
#   {"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"..."}
# on stdout with exit 0. Exit status 2 would also deny, but Copilot then shows
# only the generic `hook exited with code 2` and drops stderr (verified,
# copilot 1.0.105), so the reason would be invisible to the model.
#
# Copilot's native payload is {toolName, toolArgs:{command}, ...}. The checks
# read the Claude shape, so this adapter hands each one a synthesized
# {tool_name, tool_input:{command}} payload. That payload deliberately carries no
# `timestamp`, so fm-hook-host-lib.sh does not take it for a Copilot-delivered
# duplicate and stand the check down.
#
# The shell checks run for Copilot's `bash` tool. The subagent check runs for
# every tool: Copilot starts a subagent with the `task` tool (verified, a
# preToolUse with toolName `task` precedes subagentStart).
#
# The whole adapter is scoped to a genuine primary home through
# bin/fm-primary-scope-lib.sh, the same owner the session-start wrapper and the
# subagent guard use. A worker's worktree can carry this tracked registration
# (Copilot loads project hooks once the worktree is trusted), and the watcher-arm
# check has no scope of its own, so without this gate a Copilot worker on a
# Firstmate project would be judged by the primary's seatbelts.
#
# Payloads raised by a subagent (they carry parentAgentId) are skipped, so the
# guard judges only the primary's own calls. Malformed or empty input, a missing
# jq, and every check's own inert and fail-open paths allow the call: this
# adapter prints nothing and exits 0.
